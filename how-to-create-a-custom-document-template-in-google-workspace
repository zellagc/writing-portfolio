    <p>There are plenty of useful things you could be doing at work, but copy-pasting the same form letter into a new document over and over probably isn’t one of them. Luckily for you (and your boss), Google Workspace lets users save commonly-used types of documents as custom templates. Not only does this save time, it also ensures everyone on your team is using the same format and wording when they create that type of file.</p>
    <p><b>Heads up!</b> To create a custom template as described here, you need administrator privileges in Google Workspace. <b>This will not work from a personal Google Drive account!</b> <a href="https://workspace.google.com/" target="_blank">To learn more about Google Workspace, see this overview.</a></p>
    <h2>Why use a template?</h2>
    <p>Copy-pasting only takes a moment, right? So why go to the trouble of creating a template? Here are a few reasons templates might come in handy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Easy access.</b> If you currently duplicate commonly-used documents by copy-pasting them, you need to</p>
        <ol>
          <li>find the document to copy</li>
          <li>make a copy of the document</li>
          <li>remove specific wording that doesn't apply to your new document</li>
          <li>and THEN fill in the specific information you need in your new document!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With a template, the process is much shorter! It looks something like this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>open your custom template</li>
          <li>fill in the specific information you need in your new document</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Consistency.</b> If several people in your organization need to create the same type of document, it is likely that slight variations in wording or formatting will creep into these documents over time. A template helps avoid those problems, because rather than repeatedly copy-pasting their own work into a new document, everyone refers back to the same standard document whenever they need to create a new document of that type.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Accuracy.</b> If you duplicate documents by copy-pasting, you probably need to remove old wording, specific to the source document, and replace it with new wording, specific to your new document. It can be easy to skip over some old wording and accidentally leave it in the new document, which can be an embarrassing mistake--or, worse, can result in accidentally sharing personal details intended for one person with somebody else. Yikes!</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where are templates located?</h2>
    <p>Never used a template before? No problem! Once you're logged in to Google Workspace, they're easy to find.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Click the "New" button you would normally use to create new files.</p></li>
      <li><p>Hover over the arrow icon next to the words “Google Docs” and click “From a template.” This will bring you to the Template Gallery, a page of premade templates, including resumes, MLA- and APA-style reports, letters, project proposals, notes, brochures, newsletters, and more.</p></li>
      <li><p>To use a premade template, double-click on the image of the document template. This will open an editable copy of the template. <strong>Making changes here will not affect the template itself, only the copy of the template you have just created.</strong></p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to make a custom template</h2>
    <p>Of course, these premade templates may not suit your needs, especially if what you really want is a custom template with wording and formatting specific to your group or organization. In that case, follow these steps (<a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308885?hl=en" target="_blank">also described very succinctly here by the Google Workspace Learning Center</a>).</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><b>Create your template document.</b> Open a new document and add the content and formatting you want to appear in your template.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Open the Template Gallery</b> as described above or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?ftv=1" target="_blank">at this link</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Click "Submit template."</b> This will open a pop-up prompting you to select a document to use as a template.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Click "Select Document."</b> This will open another pop-up where you can find your newly-created template document in Google Workspace.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Click "Open" to select the file you want to turn into a template.</b></p></li>
      <li><p><b>Select a category for your template.</b> Putting your new template in a logical category will help you and your team find it easily later.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>Click "Submit."</b> Done! Now you and your team can use your new, custom template anytime you need to create a document of that type.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>While it may take you a few minutes to create your first template, using a standard template for your group or organization will save time and reduce errors in the long run. It's a great way to cut down on the boring parts of your job <em>and</em> make your team more productive. Win-win!</p>
