  <h1>How to Prepare for a Day-Long Drive</h1>
  <p>If you are traveling a long way, especially if you will need your car when you reach your destination, driving can be a practical alternative to taking a plane or bus. Depending on the distance you need to travel, making a long drive in a single day is not always safe or possible. However, there may be times when you decide to save time and money by driving all day instead of stopping at a hotel midway through your trip. If you are planning an all-day drive, preparing ahead of time will help make your drive as safe and comfortable as possible.</p>
  <h2>Prepare Your Car</h2>
  <p>To avoid accidents or delays during your trip, make sure ahead of time that your car is in good shape for a long drive.</p>
  <b>Before your drive, address any problems or suspected problems with your car.</b>
  <p>If you suspect something is wrong with your car, take the car to a mechanic or dealership or fix the problem yourself if possible. This could include problems like low tire pressure, a burned-out headlight, worn-out windshield wipers, or any other issue that impairs your ability to drive safely and comfortably. Even if you haven’t noticed problems with your car, consider taking your car to a mechanic or dealership for a tune-up before your drive, or check your car for issues yourself.</p>
  <b>Clean your windows.</b>
  <p>If you are driving from sunrise to sunset, you will probably be driving into the sun at some point during your drive. Dirty or smudged windows increase glare from the sun, which makes it harder to see the road and can be both annoying and dangerous. Clean your windows before your drive to avoid this problem.</p>
  <b>Fill your gas tank in advance.</b>
  <p>Fill your gas tank the day before your drive. This will prevent you from having to stop to buy gas more often than necessary on the day of your drive.</p>
  <h2>Prepare Your Cabin Space</h2>
  <p>For your own safety and the safety of others, you should be focused on the road while driving. Avoid distracted driving by organizing your cabin space ahead of time.</p>
  <p>Place navigation devices where you can see them easily without turning away from the road. Enter your route into the device ahead of time: focusing on your navigation device instead of the road while driving could cause you to crash. Turn on the volume so you can hear navigation instructions instead of looking away from the road to see them.</p>
  <b>Avoid distractions.</b>
  <p>Eating or drinking while driving can distract you from the road and cause you to crash. <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/811299.pdf" target="_blank">According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2010)</a>, a driver who is eating is 1.57 times more likely to be involved in a crash or near-crash than someone who is not distracted. Eat before your drive and at rest stops instead.</p>
  <p>If you need to make a call or send a text message, do so before you start your drive or at rest stops. Also, check your phone ahead of time and turn off any alarms that will go off during the drive so they will not distract you while you are driving.</p>
  <b>Adjust cabin settings ahead of time.</b>
  <p>Adjust the seat to a comfortable angle. If you need extra back support, place a pillow or rolled-up blanket behind you.</p>
  <p>Adjust your rear-view and side mirrors, steering wheel height, and cabin temperature the day before your drive. This will save you time when you start your drive the next day.</p>
  <h2>Plan Your Route</h2>
  <b>Time your drive carefully.</b>
  <p>If you will drive through a major city, know that this will take longer in the morning and evening, when people are commuting to and from work. You can save time by driving through cities when traffic is lighter, such as very early in the morning, during the middle of the day, or very late in the evening.</p>
  <b>Check the settings on your navigation device.</b>
  <p>If you are not prepared to pay tolls, set your navigation device to avoid toll roads. If you are driving alone, set it to avoid HOV lanes. If you are able to use toll roads or HOV lanes, make sure your device is not set to avoid them. Although some navigation devices automatically check for slow-downs caused by construction, consider checking your route in advance to make sure it is free of major construction projects that could delay you.</p>
  <h2>Prepare for Stops</h2>
  <p>To stay alert on your drive, stop every two or three hours to stretch, use the bathroom, eat or drink, and fill your car with gas.</p>
  <b>If you are too tired to continue driving, stop.</b>
  <p>If you are too tired to focus on driving, stop as soon as you can do so safely. If you are able to stop at a rest area, walking around the parking lot, eating a snack, or taking a quick nap in your car might help refresh you. If not, you may need to take a longer break or find a hotel where you can stay overnight. Even if you intend to finish your drive in a single day, build enough time into your schedule to accommodate a long stop, especially if your drive is very long. Driving while you are too tired to focus is dangerous, and reaching your destination safely is more important than reaching it quickly.</p>
  <p>Remember that it is not always possible or safe to make a long drive in a single day. However, if you will be making an all-day drive, preparing ahead of time will help make sure your trip is efficient, safe, and comfortable.</p>
